This program, Student Score Manager, lets the user enter a number of student scores, stores them in a dynamically allocated array, and then displays the average, maximum, and minimum scores. It demonstrates the use of dynamic memory with new and delete[], loops, and functions. The program also includes simple experiments to show what happens when memory is not released (memory leak) and when accessing freed memory (dangling pointer).
